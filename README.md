# PolCompare Repository for 2016 USA Presidential Elections

This is the PolCompare data repository for 2016 USA Presidential Elections. If you wish to contribute,
simply use the Github controls to edit files and submit pull requests, which
will be evaluated by those maintaining the repository. Feel free to also request
to help maintain the repository, because I am almost certain I don't have all the
time in the world to monitor this.

When creating a file, copy its initial content AS IS from TEMPLATE.md, and then
modify it from there.

When editing, you _must_ cite. I am not kidding about that. I don't need a
shitstorm on my hands (though, inevitably, some shit will be flung).

Contributing requires a CLA - it's pretty much a Harmony CLA, so just sign it
so that you certify that you own your contributions but this repository is licensed
to use them and I don't have to run around if something bad happens.

Want to add a topic? Great! Modify the mapping and send a PR. You'll have to modify
all the candidate files, too, but I'm sure you can do that or get some help.

I don't exactly know if the Apache License is an appropriate license for this. So
I'm still willing to change it before this gets swamped and I can't change it anymore.
Help appreciated.
